    "\n",
    "The Instacart Market Basket Analysis competition was released on Kaggle.com in May of 2017 and challenged the Kaggle community to use anonymized data from over 3 million orders to predict what would be in a given users cart the next time they placed an order. Over 2,600 people entered the competition and submitted nearly 40,000 entries before the competition closed in August of that year. While we are no longer able to participate in that challenge, we have taken it upon ourselves to come up with our own solution and see how close we can come to the best prediction models used at the time. While our experience and available resources are limited, we have the benefit of many published solutions and public discussions to help us come up with a workable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used an AMD Ryzen 7 1700X Eight-Core Processor with 16 CPUs at approximately 3.4GHz. While we also had access to an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 with 4 Gigabytes of VRAM, we were unable to utilize it for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach was to apply the tools and information we have learned in the CS 241 Machine Learning class to the problem posed by the Instacart challenge and see how our solution measured up with the rest of the field. \n"

    "<h3>Survey of other projects</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd place entry was submitted by Kazuki Onodera, a data scientist working for Yahoo!JAPAN. Onodera used XGBoost to create two gradient boosted tree models (Edwin Chen, 2017). The first predicted which previously purchased products would be in the next order. This model depended on the user and product. The second model predicted whether the user's next order would contain any previously purchased products or not. This model only depended on the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kazuki decided to use more than just the provided training set to train his models. In addition to that, he included 3 previous purchases as well. His idea was that the more data he had for training, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "His data exploration found that the most important features for predicting reorders were the 1) total number of times a user bought a specific item out of their last 5 purchases, 2) the proportion of a user's 5 most recent orders that contained an item, and 3) the longest amount of time a user has gone without buying an item in their last 5 orders. The most important features for predicting none (his second model) were whether or not a user tends to buy a lot of items at once, the maximum number of times a user has bought any item, and the maximum proportion of the 5 most recent orders in which the user bought a certain item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kazuki Oneda initially calculated his F1 score by using a yes/no threshold of 0.2, but came across a Kaggle discussion suggesting that different orders should have different thresholds. He then came up with a simulation algorithm and calculated the expected F1 score for each set of labels, starting with the highest probability items and then adding items until the F1 score peaked and then began to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Kazuki's boosting method proved to be very effective, there were many other successful approaches. The third-place winner, Sean Vasquez, an undergraduate from MIT, used a deep learning only technique and was able to achieve a mean F-score of 0.4081041. His solution was heavily dependent on the use of neural networks for feature extraction and he did not add any manually engineered features (Vasquez, 2017). While he admits that he could have benefitted from some additional features, this approach shows that using a pure deep-learning approach can be highly effective. Another submission by Colin Morris, used a recurrent neural network approach and achieved an F1 score of 0.4048802, earning him 46th place in the competition. Generally, boosting techniques seemed to dominate the leaderboard with CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM coming up frequently. \n",
    "Choosing and training a model was not the most time-consuming part of the competition for many participants. According to the discussion boards, many spent weeks creating and testing different features. Feature engineering was certainly one of the key aspects of this challenge that set some of the participants ahead of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, it appears that one user decided to publish his code about a week before the competition ended, causing quite a stir among many of the participants. Sh1ng, author of Arboretum, a gradient boosting algorithm that utilizes GPU's, released his solution with a baseline F1 score of 0.4029970 before the competition closed, which upset many users. The concern was that people would use his code and submit it as their own, putting anyone with a lower F1 score out of the top contender list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another user, Mathias Muller, username Faron, contributed a kernel 2 weeks before the end of the competition that implemented an F1 optimization algorithm from a paper entitled \"Optimizing F-measures: A Tale of Two Approaches.\" His code was widely used and cited among the contributors in top positions on the leaderboards. Some users complained about the timing of his submission, as it did provide an out of the box solution to a problem that a lot of users had already put hours of effort and time into solving.\n"

    "<h3>Methodology</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We were provided with several csv files to work with. The dataset is an open-source set provided by Instacart consisting of seven csv files containing user order data, product data, and different order metrics such as day and time of purchase. Initially we were hopeful that we could apply the methods and techniques we had learned in the machine learning class to import the data, perform some exploratory data analysis and use the tools we've been exposed to for feature extraction. It quickly became clear that we were not going to be able to do that and we started to read about feature engineering and look in earnest at the more advanced techniques that were being used by people who had participated in the competition. For a while we thought we could use Keras and neural networks to automatically generate features, but the computer hardware we were using was struggling against the large amount of data we were working with. In the end, we decided to try and replicate some of the more successful features created by users in the leaderboards such as Onodera and sh1ng. Not having previous experience in feature engineering really hurt us here in terms of time.\n"

    "The dataset has been broken up into different chunks that will need to be merged and parsed in order to create our features. The orders.csv contains user order data with 1 row per order and an eval_set designation of either prior, train or test. These designations signify which order_products file will contain the actual order data. We can see that from the total 206,209 orders we identified in the dataset, the final purchase made by 131,209 users has been labeled as train. This suggests that these final orders are going to be used to train our model. Cross referencing the order_id with the prior and train csv files confirms that the number of orders labeled as \"prior\" and \"train\" align exactly with the number of unique order_id's in the corresponding files."

    "After examining the data, it's time to start thinking about what features we can build. We merged order_products_prior.csv with products.csv and orders.csv to get the customer and order data in one place. To make a prediction on whether or not a product will be in the customer's next order, we need to come up with a few features to train the model on. We will use the labels from the train data which contains the last order from the customer.To do that, the dataframe must consist of a row for each product a customer ever ordered and a column specifying whehter that product will be in the next order or not.\n",
    "That means we need to convert all of the order data and transform the dataframe into feature based information. \n",
    "The features we are considering are:\n",
    "Total number of orders of a particular product - times purchased\n",
    "Total proportion of orders containing a given product\n",
